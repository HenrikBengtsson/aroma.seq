Version: 0.9.0 [2017-03-24]

NEW FEATURES:

 o doBWA() and BwaAlignment supports single-end alignment using also
   BAM files as input (in addition to FASTQ files).

   for BamDataFile and FastaReferenceFile.

 o Add isPaired() for BamDataFile and BamDataSet.
 
 
Version: 0.8.0 [2016-11-08]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Now the future package is attached with this package.

PERFORMANCE:

 o Now enabling parallelization via futures by default.  User still
   need to configure what futures to use in order to parallelize.

REFACTORIZATION:

   by the future package.
 
 
Version: 0.6.10 [2016-08-30]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added getSeqChecksums() for FastaReferenceFile to calculate checksums
   for individual sequences of a FASTA reference file.

 o Now print() for IlluminaFastqDataFile also report on the platform
   and file format.  It also reports on the flowcell ID, lane, barcode
   sequence, sample name, read direction and instrument ID based on
   the first sequence in the FASTQ file (iff the file format is known).

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now the constructor of IlluminaFastqDataFile asserts that
   all FASTQ files have a file format that is recognized/known.

 o ROBUSTNESS: Add isCompatibleWith() for AromaSeqDataFileSet, e.g. to check
   that all BAM files to each other use isCompatibleWith(bams, bams[[1]]).
 
 
Version: 0.6.9 [2016-01-08]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now AbstractAlignment methods assert that the output
   data set is compatible with the index set.

 o ROBUSTNESS: When finding index sets from a FASTA reference files
   it could happen that a non-compatible index set was returned.
   Now we do a better job locating and validating compatibility.
 
 
Version: 0.6.8 [2016-01-01]

BUG FIXES:

 o process() for BwaAlignment() would give error that "if (isPaired) { :
   argument is not interpretable as logical", which was do to a typo and
   caught when processed using futures.
 
 
Version: 0.6.7 [2016-01-01]

NEW FEATURES:

Version: 0.6.6 [2015-11-22]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o Package now requires R (>= 3.2.2) released August 2015.
   This allows us to use BioC (>= 3.2) (October 2015).

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now buildIndex() and readHeader() for BamDataFile
   assert that the BAM file exists before trying to parse it.
   Likewise, print() for BamDataFile no longer give an error
   if BAM file does not exist.

REFACTORIZATION:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Explicitly importing core R functions.

BUG FIXES:

 o Adjusted for Bowtie2 2.2.0 (Feb 2014) which no longer has bowtie2-align but
   bowtie2-align-s and bowtie2-align-l.
 
 
Version: 0.6.5 [2015-06-01]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Now the scoring/reporting on known orderings of sequences also recognizes
   mixed ordering with roman numeral (e.g. mouse chromosomes).

BUG FIXES:

 o readDataFrame() for FastaReferenceIndexFile did not handle large genomes
   such as the human one, because it tried to represent the file offset using
   'integer', which was not enough to represent it.
 
 
Version: 0.6.4 [2015-05-13]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added findCNVkit() and isCapableOf(aroma.seq, "CNVkit").

 o Added CnvKitCopyNumberRatio(File|Set).

   permission and give an error if such do not exist.
 
 
Version: 0.6.3 [2015-05-08]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o Using Emsembl-flavored organism names, e.g. Homo_sapiens and Mus_musculus
   (was HomoSapiens and MusMusculus).
 
 
Version: 0.6.2 [2015-05-07]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added splitByTargetType() for BamDataSet.

 o Added getFlagStat() for BamDataFile.

 o Added getIndexFile() and hasIndex() to FastaReferenceIndexFile.
   The print() method reports on the existence of the index file.

 o ROBUSTNESS: All SequenceContigsInterface classes report on
   possible ways the sequences/chromosomes are ordered.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now print() for BamDataSet warns if there are BAM files that
   have been aligned to different target sequences, which would indicate that
   different FASTA reference files have been used.

REFACTORIZATION:

 o CLEANUP: Added SequenceContigsInterface providing methods for
   querying sequence names and lengths etc.  Several classes inherits/
   implements this class, e.g. BamDataFile, FastaReferenceFile etc.
   This simplifies validation of contig compatibility.

 o CLEANUP: Package no longer warns on "'fasta.info' is deprecated".
 
 
Version: 0.6.1 [2015-05-06]

   destination directory already existed.
 
 
Version: 0.5.16 [2014-08-12]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now Bowtie2Alignment asserts that SAM read groups to
   be written do not contain spaces.

BUG FIXES:

 o Now FastQCReporter also works with FastQC (>= 0.11.1).
 
 
Version: 0.5.12 [2014-07-24]

NEW FEATURES:

 o GENERALIZATION: Now argument 'organism' can also be a file or a data
   set in addition to a character string for most methods, e.g.
   FastqDataSet(name, organism=fa) where 'fa' is a FastaReferenceFile.

 o Added argument 'transcriptomeIndexSet' to tophat().

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now getOutputDataSet() for AbstractAlignment asserts

NEW FEATURES:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now findFastQC(mustExist=FALSE) returns NULL if
   'fastqc --version' fails although 'fastqc' is found.

 o ROBUSTNESS: capabilitiesOf() always returns even if one of the
   "find" functions gives an error.
 
 
Version: 0.5.6 [2014-05-11]

   tumor-normal pair data was analyzed.

 o CLEANUP: Now FastQCReporter outputs sample directories without the
   default and auxillary '_fastqc' suffix.
 
 
Version: 0.4.37 [2014-04-10]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o Now doTopHat2() requires that 'transcripts' is explicitly specified.
   This is to protect against the mistake when the user forgets to
   specify the transcripts.

 o Now findGATK() also returns the version of GATK.
 
 
Version: 0.4.32 [2014-03-11]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Now htseqCount() also outputs a log file.

 o ROBUSTNESS: Added argument 'sortByName' to htseqCount(), which for
   now defaults to "always", because although htseq-count (>= 0.6.0)
   is supposed to handle when BAM files are sorted by position, it will
   run out of memory for modestly large BAM files.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: If the external software returns a non-zero exit code,
   then htseqCount() removes any empty count file and scans the log file
   for errors and warnings and translates them into ditto in R.
 
 
Version: 0.4.31 [2014-03-10]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added getSeqNames() for GtfDataFile.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now process() for HTSeqCounting validates that the GTF
   file has chromsome names in a format that matched the BAM files.
   If not, an error is thrown.

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now bowtie2(), bowtie2Build(), bwaAln(), bwaIndex() and so
   on use shQuote() for all pathnames.

PERFORMANCE:

 o SPEEDUP: Now htseqCount() only workaround non-supported BAM files
   for older version of htseq-count.
 
 
Version: 0.4.30 [2014-03-09]

NEW FEATURES:

   This makes it easier to test against different versions of HTSeq.

 o Added verbose output to htseqCount().

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now htseqCount() writes results atomically.

DOCUMENTATION:

 o Added Details section to help("htseqCount").

BUG FIXES:

 o getIndexStats() for BamDataFile would not work if pathname had a space or
   other symbols causing it to be split up.
 
 
Version: 0.4.29 [2014-03-08]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Now as.character()/print() for BamDataFile reports on by which software
   (and how) the BAM file was created, if the @PG SAM header is available.

NEW FEATURES:

 o Now getSampleName() passes '...' to getFullName().
 
 
Version: 0.4.24 [2014-02-25]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now explicitly forcing package tests to run either
   in sequential or in parallel mode.

BUG FIXES:

 o FastaReferenceFile$byOrganism(organism, prefix) would throw "Error: Unknown
   arguments: prefix".  Added explicit package system test for this.
 
 
Version: 0.4.23 [2014-02-20]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added writeFastaReferenceFile() for FastaReferenceSet for merging
   multiple FASTA files into a new one.

 o Added getOrganism() to FastaReferenceSet.

PERFORMANCE:

 o GENERALIZATION: Better handling of gzipped FastaReferenceFile:s,
   e.g. now byOrganism() also locates gzipped files.
 
 
Version: 0.4.22 [2014-02-03]

   'transcripts' is specified.

PERFORMANCE:

 o SPEEDUP: Now TopHat2Alignment adds a link to the FASTA file in the
   directory if the Bowtie2 index set, which then will be used by TopHat
   when processing all samples.  Previously it would create such a FASTA
   file by reverse engineering.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now tophat() and TopHat2Alignment give an informative error
   message if a *gzipped* GTF file is passed, which is not supported.

   tests assert that there are no duplicated pathnames, e.g. bowtie2(), 
   cuffdiff(), and tophat().
 
 
Version: 0.4.14 [2014-01-13]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o Bumped up package dependencies to reflect the real code requirements.

 o Reworked htseqCount() w/ modified signature, internal sam/bam sorting
   by name.
 
 
Version: 0.4.8 [2013-11-24]

PERFORMANCE:

 o SPEEDUP: Parallelized TotalCnBinnedCounting.

BUG FIXES:

   accepted_hits.bam.  This will also assert the assumption that
   TopHat2 outputs sorted BAM files, because if not indexing will
   fail and an error will be generated.

 o CLEANUP: bwaIndexPrefix() no longer adds a "methods" tags (i.e.
   'bwtsw' or 'is'), because the generated index files are identical
   regardless of method used.

NEW FEATURES:

 o CLEANUP/REDUNDANCY: Now doQDNAseq() for BamDataFile passes only the
   subset of arguments part of '...' that apply to each of the internal
   QDNAseq steps.  This means that doQDNAseq() no longer have to
   replicate the arguments of the QDNAseq package.

BUG FIXES:

 o REPRODUCIBILITY: doQDNAseq() for BamDataFile forgot to apply the
   pre-filtering step that is part of QDNAseq.
 
 
Version: 0.4.2 [2013-11-17]

NEW FEATURES:

   making it possible to distinguish between multiple FASTA files
   for the same organism.

 o CLEANUP: BwaAlignment no longer includes the BWA index 'method' as
   a tag in the output directory, because all methods outputs the exact
   same BWA index, e.g. now tag 'bwa' is added when it was 'bwa,bwtsw'.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now buildBwaIndexSet(..., method="is") checks for maximum
   size of reference genome (2GB) and gives an informative error if the
   FASTA file is greater.

 o ROBUSTNESS: If read group ID is missing, process() for BwaAlignment
   sets it to be the same as the fullname of the filename.  Same for
   the SM read group.  This as the advantage of aligned BAM files are
   more likely to be mergable afterward.

 o ROBUSTNESS: The default method for building BWA indices is now 'bwtsw',
   because contrary to the previous default ('is'), the new one supports
   larger genomes as well (such as the human genome) and will always work.
   It is useful to understand that regardless of choice, the generated
   index sets are always identical across building methods.  There is
   a package system test asserting this fact.

BUG FIXES:

 o BwaIndexSet$byPrefix(prefix) would find any BWA index set in directory
   dirname(prefix) without matching filenames of the set to basename(prefix).

 o process(..., dropEmpty=TRUE) for GatkAlleleCounting is now much faster.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now convertToBamDataSet() for SamDataSet asserts that the
   output set is complete.

BUG FIXES:

 o process() for BwaAlignment and Bowtie2Alignment was only align the first
   sample regardless on input data set.  This bug was introduced in
   aroma.seq v0.1.27.

 o getOutputDataSet() for AbstractAlignment and PicardDuplicateRemoval could
   return data sets with "missing" files, if the method was not completed.
   Now they only returns the existing output files.

   seq(ds) where 'ds' is GenericDataFileSet is now replaced by seq_along(ds).
   Likewise, seq_len(x) replaces seq(length=x), and length(ds) replaces 
   nbrOfFiles(ds).
 
 
Version: 0.1.26 [2012-11-09]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added argument 'dropEmpty' to GatkAlleleCounting, which will drop all SNPs
   with zero coverage from the output files making the smaller and faster to 
   read, particularly for low coverage samples.

Version: 0.1.19 [2012-10-21]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Now using Arguments$getWritablePath() everywhere instead
   of mkdirs(), because the former will do a better job in creating
   and asserting directories on slow shared file systems, and when it
   fails it gives a more informative error message.

BUG FIXES:

 o FIX: Now BwaAligment will use a default SAM read group ID of 1 (cf. Picard
   AddOrReplaceReadGroups) if missing.  Previously it gave an error instead.
